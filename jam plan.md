# Brainstorm

card game
balance life
each card changes your stats
stats:
 - time: spent to play cards; refills start of every turn
 - food: spent every turn (maybe some big cards too); lose if not enough
 - money: spent to play some cards, spent every 7 turns (rent), earned by playing cards
 - passion: big resource sink, multiplys score for each turn, slowly decreases each turn
each turn is a day
